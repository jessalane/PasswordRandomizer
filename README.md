# Password Randomizer

## Description

If you've ever had a problem coming up with a unique password, that isn't specific to your own life and experiences, look no further. 

The following is a password generator. When you click on the Generate Password button a popup will appear with critera the user can select to use in their password. A minimum of one character for each selection will be used in the final password. If a number lower than 8 or higher than 128 is input for the password length, an error message will appear, and you will be unable to submit your request until it is fixed. 

## Usage
The following are two pictures of what the website should look like when opened in a browser. The first is the main page, the second is of the popup once you click the generate password button.
